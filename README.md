# Employee Tracker

## Description

I was given the task of creating a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database. An application like this is called a Content Managemnt System. Developers frequently have to create interfaces like these that allow clients to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. While making this application, I learned how to ensure that JavaScript, Node.js, and Inquirer all work together to connect with a MySQL database througth the command-line.

## Usage

First you will need to install Node.js. Next, ensure that the Node Modules of Inquirer and MySQL2 are included. Once those are installed, open the PowerShell Terminal and log into mySQL. Then you can source the schema.sql file to create the employeetracker_db and tables. Once you source the seeds.sql file the employeetracker_db will be filled with all the data. Finally, open the Integrated Terminal and run the server.js file by typing 'node server.js'. Just follow the prompts to complete the actions that you desire.
